Here is the quad frame that, along with a 3d printer, never dies. This durable frame is the result of about a dozen iterations that have led to this lightweight, clean and dirty plate design, that can be built with nearly all 3d printed components. I release it here under the apache license with the intent that we can all grow this together to try and make a constantly improving quad. 

To BUILD:
Print 
4x bottom motor mounts
4x top motor mounts
1x Center Section-1
1x Center Section-2 

For FPV Add:
